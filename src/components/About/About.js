At the same time, we are committed to providing immigrant New Yorkers with ESL classes that accommodate their needs and prepare them to be part of the society where they live, work and educate their children. The curriculum at  Language Center is designed to support this mission by providing students with the necessary language tools to help them achieve their goals.  Language Center is committed to excellence and service at the highest degree.</p>
